I have been toying with the idea of creating a blog for a while, without actually getting around to doing it.

This morning I woke up around 5am, I had a bit of time before my son woke up, and figured I would give it a go.
After a quick google, I found it is pretty easy to set something up using github pages, but what it gave me out
of the box looked a bit bland. I returned to again to look for some themes, and liked the look of
[clean blog theme](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll).

I had not used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/) before, and didn't have 
[ruby installed](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac).
After setting up Ruby and Jekyll, I was able to get the theme up and running.

I also stumbled across a neat tool called [utterances](https://github.com/utterance)
to enable comments on my posts, it is a lightweight widget that utilities GitHub issues,
required very little effort to set up, and looks pretty good so far.

This as an introductory and test post. I hope that Ill be able to find time to write some more
(hopefully more interesting!) posts in the future.

I am currently reading
[Elegant Objects Volume 1 by Yegor Bugayenko](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elegant-Objects-1-Yegor-Bugayenko/dp/1519166915)
and part of the reason for creating this blog is to enable writing a blog post that can be used to support a
discussion around some of the topics at work, whether I will actually get around to doing it remains to be seen,
watch this space!
