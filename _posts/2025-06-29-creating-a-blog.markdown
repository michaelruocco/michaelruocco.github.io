I had been toying with the idea of creating a blog for a while without actually getting around to it.

This morning I woke up around 5am so I had a bit of time before my son woke up, so figured I would give it a go. After
a quick google I found that is pretty easy to set something up using github pages, what it gave me out of the
box looked a bit bland, so I resorted to google again to look for some themes, I liked the look of
[clean blog theme](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll).

I had not used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/) before, and didn't have 
[ruby installed](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac). After setting up Ruby and Jekyll, I was able to get
[clean blog theme](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) up and running.

I drafted this as an introductory / test blog post. I hope that Ill be able to find time to write some more
interesting blog posts in the future. I have recently read
[Elegant Objects Volume 1 by Yegor Bugayenko](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elegant-Objects-1-Yegor-Bugayenko/dp/1519166915)
and part of the reason for creating this blog is enable writing a blog post that can be used to support a
discussion around some of the topics at work, whether I will actually get around to doing it remains to be seen,
watch this space!
